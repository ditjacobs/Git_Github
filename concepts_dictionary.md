# Concepts 

**The difference between Git and Github is:** 
Git is used to track changes when working on a project. Files have to be commited, so a timeline is created. Can help to navigate to different versions. 
Github backs up all the "timelines", collects different Git projects. Online repository (BackUp)

**Why you should not initialize git twice** 
Git init will initialize a git repository. When git is initialized twice, changes will be tracked in both git repositories, but we want to separate these timelines. 

**The Developing area**
This is located locally (on my computer) in an assigned folder 

**The Staging area**
Location to prepare for a commit, prepare the snapshots of the timeline. Staging area is important when working with several files, and I need to classify the ones i want to commit together.

**The Local repository** 
This is the git repository `.git`initialized with git init, keeps track of the timeline 

Testing a no msg commit. 


**Remote repository**
The remote repository is Github, where all the timelines for all projects are stored.

**Solving conflicts**
Pull all contents, and adapt the changes accordingly. Push the resolved file to Github. 

**Tagging**
adding a tag to commit jobs to track specific version

**Difference between git checkout and git show**
Git checkout is used to move between branches and commits, while git show will show the content and differences between commited jobs
