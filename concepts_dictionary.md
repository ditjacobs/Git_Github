# Concepts 

**The difference between Git and Github is:** 
Git is used to track changes when working on a project. Files have to be commited, so a timeline is created. Can help to navigate to different versions. 
Github backs up all the "timelines", collects different Git projects. Online repository (BackUp)

**Why you should not initialize git twice** 
Git init will initialize a git repository. When git is initialized twice, changes will be tracked in both git repositories, but we want to separate these timelines. 

**The Developing area**
This is located locally (on my computer) in an assigned folder 

**The Staging area**
Location to prepare for a commit, prepare the snapshots of the timeline 

**The Local repository** 
This is the git repository `.git`initialized with git init, keeps track of the timeline 

Testing a no msg commit.
